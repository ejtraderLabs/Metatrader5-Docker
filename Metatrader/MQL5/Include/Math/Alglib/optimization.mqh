//| This structure is used to store OptGuard report, i.e. report on  |
//| the properties of the nonlinear function being optimized with    |
//| ALGLIB.                                                          |
//| After you tell your optimizer to activate OptGuardthis technology|
//| starts to silently monitor function values and gradients /       |
//| Jacobians being passed all around during your optimization       |
//| session. Depending on specific set of checks enabled OptGuard may|
//| perform additional function evaluations (say, about 3*N          |
//| evaluations if you want to check analytic gradient for errors).  |
//| Upon discovering that something strange happens (function values |
//| and/or gradient components change too sharply and/or             |
//| unexpectedly) OptGuard sets one of the "suspicion  flags"        |
//| (without interrupting optimization session).                     |
//| After optimization is done, you can examine OptGuard report.     |
//| Following report fields can be set:                              |
//|      * nonc0suspected                                            |
//|      * nonc1suspected                                            |
//|      * badgradsuspected                                          |
//| === WHAT CAN BE DETECTED WITH OptGuard INTEGRITY CHECKER =====   |
//| Following types of errors in your target function (constraints)  |
//| can be caught:                                                   |
//|   a) discontinuous functions ("non-C0" part of the report)       |
//|   b) functions with discontinuous derivative ("non-C1" part of   |
//|      the report)                                                 |
//|   c) errors in the analytic gradient provided by user            |
//| These types of errors result in optimizer stopping well before   |
//| reaching solution (most often - right after encountering         |
//| discontinuity).                                                  |
//| Type A errors are usually coding errors during  implementation   |
//| of the target function. Most "normal" problems involve continuous|
//| functions, and anyway you can't reliably optimize discontinuous  |
//| function.                                                        |
//| Type B errors are either coding errors or (in case code itself is|
//| correct) evidence of the fact that your problem is an "incorrect"|
//| one. Most optimizers (except for ones provided by MINNS          |
//| subpackage) do not support nonsmooth problems.                   |
//| Type C errors are coding errors which often prevent optimizer    |
//| from making even one step  or result in optimizing stopping too  |
//| early, as soon as actual descent direction becomes too different |
//| from one suggested by user-supplied gradient.                    |
//| === WHAT IS REPORTED =========================================== |
//| Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous target   |
//| functions, ones not belonging to C0 continuity class:            |
//|   * nonc0suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some|
//|     indication of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the  |
//|     rest of "non-C0" fields should be ignored                    |
//|   * nonc0fidx - is an index of the function (0 for target        |
//|     function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints) which is    |
//|     suspected of being "non-C0"                                  |
//|   * nonc0lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function which was|
//|     suspected of being non-continuous.                           |
//|   * nonc0test0positive - set to indicate specific test which     |
//|     detected continuity violation (test #0)                      |
//| Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous gradient/|
//| Jacobian, i.e. with functions violating C1 continuity:           |
//|   * nonc1suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some|
//|     indication of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the  |
//|     rest of "non-C1" fields should be ignored                    |
//|   * nonc1fidx - is an index of the function (0 for target        |
//|     function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints) which is    |
//|     suspected of being "non-C1"                                  |
//|   * nonc1lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function gradient |
//|     which was suspected of being non-smooth.                     |
//|   * nonc1test0positive - set to indicate specific test which     |
//|     detected continuity violation (test #0)                      |
//|   * nonc1test1positive - set to indicate specific test which     |
//|     detected continuity violation (test #1)                      |
//| Following set of report fields deals with errors in the gradient:|
//|   * badgradsuspected - is a flad which is set upon discovering an|
//|     error in the analytic gradient supplied by user              |
//|   * badgradfidx - index  of the function with bad gradient (0 for|
//|     target function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints)      |
//|   * badgradvidx - index of the variable                          |
//|   * badgradxbase - location where Jacobian is tested             |
//|   * following  matrices  store  user-supplied Jacobian and its   |
//|     numerical differentiation version (which is assumed to be    |
//|     free from the coding errors), both of them computed near the |
//|     initial point:                                               |
//|         * badgraduser, an array[K,N], analytic Jacobian supplied |
//|           by user                                                |
//|         * badgradnum,  an array[K,N], numeric  Jacobian computed |
//|           by ALGLIB                                              |
//| Here K is a total number of nonlinear functions (target  +       |
//| nonlinear constraints), N is a variable number.                  |
//| The element of badgraduser[] with index [badgradfidx,badgradvidx]|
//| is assumed to be wrong.                                          |
//| More detailed error log can be obtained from optimizer by        |
//| explicitly requesting reports for tests C0.0, C1.0, C1.1.        |

//| This structure is used for detailed reporting about suspected C1 |
//| continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #1 (OptGuard  has     |
//| several tests for C1 continuity, this report is used by #1).     |
//| === WHAT IS TESTED ============================================= |
//| C1 test #1 studies individual  components  of  the  gradient  as |
//| recorded during line searches. Upon discovering discontinuity in |
//| the gradient  this test records specific component which was     |
//| suspected (or  one  with  highest indication of discontinuity if |
//| multiple components are suspected).                              |
//| When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more     |
//| powerful than test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and |
//| ignores  user-provided gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes    |
//| more powerful when numerical differentiation is employed (in such|
//| cases test #1 detects  higher  levels of numerical noise and     |
//| becomes too conservative).                                       |
//| This test also tells specific components of the gradient which   |
//| violate C1 continuity, which makes it more informative than #0,  |
//| which just tells that continuity is violated.                    |
//| === WHAT IS REPORTED =========================================== |
//| Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report           |
//| structures:                                                      |
//|   * one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest |
//|     change in the directional derivative), so called "strongest" |
//|     report                                                       |
//|   * another one for most detailed line search (more function     |
//|     evaluations = easier to understand what's going on) which    |
//|     triggered test #1 criteria, so called "longest" report       |
//| In both cases following fields are returned:                     |
//|   * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;      |
//|     FALSE if test did not notice anything (in the latter cases   |
//|     fields below are empty).                                     |
//|   * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, |
//|     1 or higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of |
//|     being "non-C1"                                               |
//|   * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth   |
//|     derivative                                                   |
//|   * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point and |
//|     direction for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does   |
//|     not have to)                                                 |
//|   * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths   |
//|     and gradient values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in    |
//|     x0+stp[i]*d and contains vidx-th component of the gradient.  |
//|   * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1 |
//|     continuity between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we   |
//|     have stpidxb=stpidxa+3, with most likely  position  of  the  |
//|     violation  between  stpidxa+1 and stpidxa+2.                 |
//| You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  g[]  arrays   |
//| and study behavior of your function by your own eyes, just to be |
//| sure that test correctly reported C1 violation.                  |

//|         NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD                      |
//| DESCRIPTION:                                                     |
//| The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using   |
//| one of the nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.                 |
//| These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex     |
//| functions) as long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in a some  |
//| neighborhood of the L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.                     |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//| Algorithm will request following information during its          |
//| operation:                                                       |
//| * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given  |
//|   point X                                                        |
//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| 1. User initializes algorithm State with MinCGCreate() call      |
//| 2. User tunes m_solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(),             |
//|    MinCGSetStpMax() and other functions                          |
//| 3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm     |
//|    State and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which |
//|    calculates F/G.                                               |
//| 4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution                     |
//| 5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another |
//|    problem with same N but another starting point and/or another |
//|    function. MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already          |
//|    initialized structure.                                        |

//| 1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.   |
//| 2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to              |
//|    DiffStep*S[I] where S[] is scaling vector which can be set by |
//|    MinCGSetScale() call.                                         |
//| 3. we recommend you to use moderate values of differentiation    |
//|    step. Too large step will result in too large truncation      |
//|    errors, while too small step will result in too large         |
//|    numerical errors. 1.0E-6 can be good value to start with.     |
//| 4. Numerical differentiation is very inefficient - one gradient  |
//|    calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will|
//|    work for any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or|
//|    large  (100...). However, performance penalty will be too     |
//|    severe for any N's except for small ones.                     |
//|    We should also say that code which relies on numerical        |
//|    differentiation is less robust and precise. L-BFGS  needs     |
//|    exact gradient values. Imprecise gradient may slow down       |
//|    convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.         |
//|    Thus we recommend to use this function for fast prototyping   |
//|    on small- dimensional problems only, and to implement         |
//|    analytical gradient as soon as possible.                      |

//| Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG          |
//| optimizer - step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].      |

//| This function activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring     |
//| option of the OptGuard integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor   |
//| silently observes solution process and tries to detect ill-posed |
//| problems, i.e. ones with:                                        |
//|   a) discontinuous target function(non - C0)                     |
//|   b) nonsmooth     target function(non - C1)                     |
//| Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it|
//| suspects that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets            |
//| corresponding flags in the OptGuard report which can be retrieved|
//| after optimization is over.                                      |
//| Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often  |
//| adds less than 1 % to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can  |
//| use it even for large scale problems.                            |
//| NOTE: OptGuard does NOT guarantee that  it  will  always  detect |
//|       C0 / C1 continuity violations.                             |
//| First, minor errors are hard to catch-say, a 0.0001 difference in|
//| the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to           |
//| discontinuity of the model - or simply because the model has     |
//| changed.                                                         |
//| Second, C1 - violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  |
//| in a noninvasive way. The optimizer usually performs very  short |
//| steps near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually       |
//| introduces a lot of numerical noise. It is hard to tell whether  |
//| some tiny discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness|
//| or just  due to numerical noise alone.                           |
//| Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare   |
//| cases minor errors may went unnoticed(however, in most cases they|
//| can be spotted with restart from different initial point).       |

//|                        recorded, but OptGuard does not try to    |
//|                        perform additional evaluations  in  order |
//|                        to get more information about suspicious  |

//| === EXPLANATION ================================================ |
//| One major source of headache during optimization is the          |
//| possibility of the coding errors in the target function /        |
//| constraints (or their gradients). Such errors most often manifest|
//| themselves  as  discontinuity  or nonsmoothness of the target /  |
//| constraints.                                                     |
//| Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something |
//| involving lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth     |
//| target. Although not a coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway -|
//| and smooth  optimizers  usually stop right after encountering    |
//| nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.                    |
//| OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations:   |
//| it monitors function values / gradients being passed  to  the    |
//| optimizer  and  tries  to errors. Upon discovering suspicious    |
//| pair of points it  raises  appropriate flag (and allows you to   |
//| continue optimization). When optimization is done, you can study |
//| OptGuard result.                                                 |

//| === PRIMARY REPORT ============================================= |
//| OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch     |
//| common errors in the implementation of nonlinear function /      |
//| gradient:                                                        |
//|      * incorrect analytic gradient                               |
//|      * discontinuous(non - C0) target functions (constraints)    |
//|      * nonsmooth(non - C1) target functions (constraints)        |
//| Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:     |
//|      * MinCGOptGuardGradient() for gradient verification         |
//|      * MinCGOptGuardSmoothness() for C0 / C1 checks              |
//| Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:         |
//|      * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:                   |
//|      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element)  |
//|                        suspected                                 |
//|      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested        |

//|                         report  structure  compatible  with  more|
//|                         complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM) |

//|                         differentiation(stored as  2D matrix with|
//|                         single row in order to make report       |

//| === ADDITIONAL REPORTS / LOGS ================================== |
//| Several different tests are performed to catch C0 / C1 errors,   |
//| you can find out specific test signaled error by looking to:     |
//|      * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non - C0 test #0              |
//|      * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non - C1 test #0              |
//|      * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non - C1 test #1              |
//| Additional information (including line search logs) can be       |
//| obtained by means of:                                            |
//|      * MinCGOptGuardNonC1Test0Results()                          |
//|      * MinCGOptGuardNonC1Test1Results()                          |
//| which return detailed error reports, specific points where       |
//| discontinuities were found, and so on.                           |
//| ================================================================ |

//|   Rep      -  generic OptGuard report; more  detailed  reports   |
//|               can  be retrieved with other functions.            |
//| NOTE: false negatives(nonsmooth problems are not identified as   |
//|       nonsmooth ones) are possible although unlikely.            |
//| The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations    |
//| around nonsmoothness  in order to accumulate enough information  |
//| about function curvature. Say, if you start right from the       |
//| nonsmooth point, optimizer simply won't get enough data to       |
//| understand what is going wrong before it terminates due to abrupt|
//| changes in the  derivative. It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"|
//| step  will  move  us  to  the termination too quickly.           |
//| Our current approach is to have less than 0.1 %  false  negatives|
//| in our test examples (measured with multiple restarts from random|
//| points), and to have exactly 0 % false positives.                |

//| 1. This function has two different implementations: one which    |
//|    uses exact (analytical) user-supplied  gradient, and one which|
//|    uses function value only and numerically differentiates       |
//|    function in order to obtain gradient.                         |
//|    Depending on the specific function used to create optimizer   |
//|    object (either MinCGCreate() for analytical gradient or       |
//|    MinCGCreateF() for numerical differentiation) you should      |
//|    choose appropriate variant of MinCGOptimize() - one which     |
//|    accepts function AND gradient or one which accepts function   |
//|    ONLY.                                                         |
//|    Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize() which         |
//|    corresponds to your optimization scheme! Table below lists    |
//|    different combinations of callback (function/gradient) passed |

//|    MinCGCreateF() and to pass gradient information to            |
//|    MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception being thrown. Either  |

//--- Perform orthogonalization of general linear constraints with respect

//--- box constraints). During this process we select strictly active constraints
//--- from the candidate set, and drop ones which were detected as redundant
//--- during orthogonalization.
//--- Orthogonalization is performed with the help of Gram-Schmidt process.
//--- Due to accumulation of round-off errors it is beneficial to perform
//--- pivoting, i.e. to select candidate vector with largest norm at each
//--- step.
//--- First (basic) version of the algorithm is:
//---     0. split all constraints into two sets: basis ones (initially empty)
//---        and candidate ones (all constraints)
//---     1. fill PBasis with H-normalized candidate constraints, fill
//---        corresponding entries of S/IBasis with corresponding
//---        (non-normalized) constraints
//---     2. select row of PBasis with largest norm, move it (and its S/IBasis
//---        counterparts) to the beginning of the candidate set, H-normalize
//---        this row (rows of S/IBasis are normalized using corresponding norms).
//---        Stop if largest row is nearly (or exactly) zero.
//---     3. orthogonalize remaining rows of P/S/IBasis with respect to
//---        one chosen at step (2). It can be done efficiently using
//---        combination of DGEMV/DGER BLAS calls.
//---     4. increase basis size by one, decrease candidate set size by one,
//---        goto (2)
//--- However, naive implementation of the algorithm above spends significant
//--- amount of time in step (2) - selection of row with largest H-norm. Step
//--- (3) can be efficiently implemented with optimized BLAS, but we have no
//--- optimized BLAS kernels for step(2). And because step (3) changes row norms,
//--- step (2) have to be re-calculated every time, which is quite slow.
//--- We can save significant amount of calculations by noticing that:
//--- * step (3) DECREASES row norms, but never increases it
//--- * we can maintain upper bounds for row H-norms is a separate array,
//---   use them for initial evaluation of best candidates, and update them
//---   after we find some promising row (all bounds are invalidated after
//---   step 3, but their old values still carry some information)
//--- * it is beneficial re-evaluate bounds only for rows which are
//---   significantly (at least few percents) larger than best one found so far
//--- * because rows are initially normalized, initial values for upper bounds
//---   can be set to 1.0

//--- General case.
//--- APPROACH TO CONSTRAINTS ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION
//--- We have NActiveConstraints "candidates": NActiveBnd boundary candidates,
//--- NActiveLin linear candidates. Indexes of boundary constraints are stored
//--- in RCTmpConstraintIdx[0:NActiveBnd-1], indexes of linear ones are stored
//--- in RCTmpConstraintIdx[NActiveBnd:NActiveBnd+NActiveLin-1]. Some of the
//--- constraints are equality ones, some are inequality - as specified by
//--- RCTmpIsEquality[i].
//--- Now we have to determine active subset of "candidates" set. In order to
//--- do so we solve following constrained minimization problem:
//---         (                         )^2
//---     min ( SUM(lambda[i]*A[i]) + G )
//---         (                         )
//--- Here:
//--- * G is a gradient (column vector)
//--- * A[i] is a column vector, linear (left) part of I-th constraint.
//---   I=0..NActiveConstraints-1, first NActiveBnd elements of A are just
//---   subset of identity matrix (boundary constraints), next NActiveLin
//---   elements are subset of rows of the matrix of general linear constraints.
//--- * lambda[i] is a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to I-th constraint
//--- NOTE: for preconditioned setting A is replaced by A*H^(-0.5), G is
//---       replaced by G*H^(-0.5). We apply this scaling at the last stage,
//---       before passing data to NNLS m_solver.
//--- Minimization is performed subject to non-negativity constraints on
//--- lambda[i] corresponding to inequality constraints. Inequality constraints
//--- which correspond to non-zero lambda are activated, equality constraints
//--- are always considered active.
//--- Informally speaking, we "decompose" descent direction -G and represent
//--- it as sum of constraint vectors and "residual" part (which is equal to
//--- the actual descent direction subject to constraints).
//--- SOLUTION OF THE NNLS PROBLEM
//--- We solve this optimization problem with Non-Negative Least Squares m_solver,
//--- which can efficiently solve least squares problems of the form
//---         ( [ I | AU ]     )^2
//---     min ( [   |    ]*x-b )   s.m_t. non-negativity constraints on some x[i]
//---         ( [ 0 | AL ]     )
//--- In order to use this m_solver we have to rearrange rows of A[] and G in
//--- such way that first NActiveBnd columns of A store identity matrix (before
//--- sorting non-zero elements are randomly distributed in the first NActiveBnd
//--- columns of A, during sorting we move them to first NActiveBnd rows).
//--- Then we create instance of NNLS m_solver (we reuse instance left from the
//--- previous run of the optimization problem) and solve NNLS problem.

//| The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments subject to |

//| * bound constraints                                              |

//| * linear equality constraints                                    |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//| * user must provide function value and gradient                  |
//| * starting point X0 must be feasible or                          |
//|   not too far away from the feasible set                         |
//| * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:           |
//|   L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }                                        |
//| * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F      |
//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| Constrained optimization if far more complex than the            |
//| unconstrained one. Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC  |
//| optimizer. We strongly recommend you to read examples in the     |
//| ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide on         |
//| optimization, which is available at                              |
//| http://www.alglib.net/optimization/                              |
//| 1. User initializes algorithm State with MinBLEICCreate() call   |
//| 2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling       |
//|    MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.                |
//| 3. User sets stopping conditions for underlying unconstrained    |
//|    m_solver with MinBLEICSetInnerCond() call.                      |
//|    This function controls accuracy of underlying optimization    |
//|    algorithm.                                                    |
//| 4. User sets stopping conditions for outer iteration by calling  |
//|    MinBLEICSetOuterCond() function.                              |
//|    This function controls handling of boundary and inequality    |
//|    constraints.                                                  |
//| 5. Additionally, user may set limit on number of internal        |
//|    iterations by MinBLEICSetMaxIts() call.                       |
//|    This function allows to prevent algorithm from looping        |
//|    forever.                                                      |
//| 6. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  |
//|    State and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function       |
//|    which calculates F/G.                                         |
//| 7. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution                  |
//| 8. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve       |
//|    another problem with same N but another starting point.       |
//|    MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized     |
//|    structure.                                                    |

//| NOTES:                                                           |
//| 1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.   |
//| 2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I]|
//|    where S[] is scaling vector which can be set by               |
//|    MinBLEICSetScale() call.                                      |
//| 3. we recommend you to use moderate values of differentiation    |
//|    step. Too large step will result in too large truncation      |
//|    errors, while too small step will result in too large         |
//|    numerical errors. 1.0E-6 can be good value to start with.     |
//| 4. Numerical differentiation is very inefficient - one  gradient |
//|    calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will|
//|    work for any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or|
//|    large (100...). However, performance penalty will be too      |
//|    severe for any N's except for small ones.                     |
//|    We should also say that code which relies on numerical        |
//|    differentiation is less robust and precise. CG needs exact    |
//|    gradient values. Imprecise gradient may slow down convergence,|
//|    especially on highly nonlinear problems.                      |
//|    Thus we recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on|
//|    small - dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical|
//|    gradient as soon as possible.                                 |

//| This function activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring     |

//|   a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)                      |
//|   b) nonsmooth  target function (non-C1)                         |
//| Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization even if it |

//| after optimization is over.                                      |
//| Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often  |

//| First, minor errors are hard to catch - say, a 0.0001 difference |
//| in the model values at two sides of the gap may be due           |
//| to discontinuity of the model - or simply because the model has  |
//| changed.                                                         |
//| Second, C1-violations are especially difficult to detect in a    |
//| noninvasive way. The optimizer usually performs very short steps |
//| near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation usually introduces a |

//|                     about suspicious locations.                  |
//| === EXPLANATION ================================================ |
//| One major source of headache during optimization is the          |
//| possibility of the coding errors in the target function /        |
//| constraints (or their gradients). Such errors most often manifest|
//| themselves as discontinuity or nonsmoothness of the target /     |
//| constraints.                                                     |
//| Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something |
//| involving lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth     |
//| target. Although not a coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway -|
//| and smooth optimizers usually stop right after encountering      |
//| nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.                    |
//| OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it|
//| monitors function values/gradients being passed to the optimizer |
//| and tries to errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points  |
//| it raises appropriate flag (and allows you to continue           |
//| optimization). When optimization is done, you can study OptGuard |
//| result.                                                          |

//| === PRIMARY REPORT ============================================= |
//| OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch     |
//| common errors in the implementation of nonlinear function /      |
//| gradient:                                                        |
//|   * incorrect analytic gradient                                  |
//|   * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)        |
//|   * nonsmooth  (non-C1) target functions (constraints)           |
//| Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:     |
//|   * MinBLEICOptGuardGradient() for gradient verification         |
//|   * MinBLEICOptGuardSmoothness() for C0/C1 checks                |
//| Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:         |
//|   * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:                      |
//|      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element)  |
//|        suspected                                                 |
//|      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested        |
//|      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient (stored as 2D     |
//|        matrix with single row in order to make report structure  |
//|        compatible with more complex optimizers like MinNLC or    |
//|        MinLM)                                                    |
//|      * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient obtained via numerical |
//|        differentiation (stored as 2D matrix with single row in   |
//|        order to make report structure compatible with more       |
//|        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)                  |
//|   * rep.nonc0suspected                                           |
//|   * rep.nonc1suspected                                           |
//| === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==================================== |
//| Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you |
//| can find out specific test signaled error by looking to:         |
//|   * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0                   |
//|   * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0                   |
//|   * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1                   |
//| Additional information (including line search logs) can be       |
//| obtained by means of:                                            |
//|   * MinBLEICOptGuardNonC1Test0Results()                          |
//|   * MinBLEICOptGuardNonC1Test1Results()                          |
//| which return detailed error reports, specific points where       |
//| discontinuities were found, and so on.                           |
//| ================================================================ |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |
//|   State    -  algorithm State                                    |

//|   Rep      -  generic OptGuard report; more detailed reports     |
//|               can be retrieved with other functions.             |
//| NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  |
//|       nonsmooth ones) are possible although unlikely.            |
//| The reason is that you need to make several evaluations around   |
//| nonsmoothness in order to accumulate enough information about    |
//| function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth   |
//| point, optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what |
//| is going wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the |
//| derivative. It is also possible that "unlucky" step will move us |
//| to the termination too quickly.                                  |
//| Our current approach is to have less than 0.1% false negatives in|
//| our test examples (measured with multiple restarts from random   |
//| points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.                 |

//| DESCRIPTION:                                                     |
//| The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using a |
//| quasi - Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use a |
//| minimum  amount of memory.                                       |
//| The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian |
//| matrix by using information about the last M steps of the        |
//| algorithm (instead of N). It lessens a required amount of memory |
//| from a value of order N^2 to a value of order 2*N*M.             |

//| 1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.   |
//| 2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I]|
//|    where S[] is scaling vector which can be set by               |
//|    MinLBFGSSetScale() call.                                      |

//|    step. Too large step will result in too large truncation      |
//|    errors, while too small step will result in too large         |
//|    numerical errors. 1.0E-6 can be good value to start with.     |
//| 4. Numerical differentiation is very inefficient - one gradient  |
//|    calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will|
//|    work for any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or|
//|    large (100...). However, performance penalty will be too      |
//|    severe for any N's except for small ones.                     |
//|    We should also say that code which relies on numerical        |
//|    differentiation is less robust and precise. LBFGS needs exact |

//| Step is bounded subject to boundary constraints.                 |
//| Candidate steps are divided into two groups:                     |
//|  *"default" step, which is always performed when no candidate  |
//|     steps LONGER THAN THE DEFAULT ONE is given. This candidate   |
//|     MUST reduce target function value; it is responsibility of   |
//|     caller to provide default candidate which reduces target     |
//|     function.                                                    |
//|  *"additional candidates", which may be shorter or longer than |
//|     the default step. Candidates which are shorter that the      |
//|     default step are ignored; candidates which are longer than   |
//|     the "default" step are tested.                               |
//| The idea is that we ALWAYS try "default" step, and it is         |
//| responsibility of the caller to provide us with something which  |
//| is worth trying. This step may activate some constraint - that's |
//| why we stopped at "default" step size. However, we may also try  |

//|   * This algorithm is inefficient on problems with hundreds and  |
//|     thousands of general inequality constraints and infeasible   |
//|     initial point. Initial feasibility detection stage may take  |
//|     too long on such constraint sets. Consider using DENSE-IPM   |
//|     or DENSE-AUL instead.                                        |
//|   * unlike QuickQP solver, this algorithm does not perform Newton|
//|     steps and does not use Level 3 BLAS. Being general-purpose   |
//|     active set method, it can activate constraints only          |

//| ===== TRACING IPM SOLVER ======================================= |
//| IPM solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace |
//| algorithm output by specifying following trace symbols           |
//| (case-insensitive)  by  means of trace_file() call:              |
//|   * 'IPM'  -  for basic trace of algorithm  steps and decisions. |
//|               Only short scalars(function values and deltas) are |
//|               printed. N-dimensional quantities like search      |
//|               directions are NOT printed.                        |
//|   * 'IPM.DETAILED' - for output of points being visited and      |
//|               search directions. This symbol also implicitly     |
//|               defines 'IPM'. You can control output format by    |
//|               additionally specifying:                           |
//|               * nothing      to output in  6-digit exponential   |
//|                              format                              |
//|               * 'PREC.E15'   to output in 15-digit exponential   |
//|                              format                              |
//|               * 'PREC.F6'    to output in  6-digit fixed-point   |
//|                              format                              |
//| By default trace is disabled and adds no overhead to the         |
//| optimization process. However, specifying any of the symbols adds|
//| some formatting and output - related overhead.                   |
//| You may specify multiple symbols by separating them with commas: |
//|   >                                                              |

//|     NOT supported by this solver                                 |
//|   * can solve all types of problems (convex, semidefinite,       |
//|     nonconvex) as long as they are bounded from below under      |
//|     constraints. Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject |
//|     to -1<=x<=+1". In convex/semidefinite case global minimum  is|
//|     returned, in nonconvex case-algorithm returns one of the     |
//|     local minimums.                                              |
//| ALGORITHM OUTLINE:                                               |
//|   * algorithm  performs  two kinds of iterations: constrained CG |
//|     iterations and constrained Newton iterations                 |
//|   * initially it performs small number of constrained CG         |
//|     iterations, which can efficiently activate/deactivate        |
//|     multiple constraints                                         |
//|   * after CG phase algorithm tries to calculate Cholesky         |
//|     decomposition and to perform several constrained Newton      |
//|     steps. If  Cholesky  decomposition failed(matrix is          |
//|     indefinite even under constraints), we perform more CG       |
//|     iterations until we converge to such set of constraints that |
//|     system matrix becomes positive definite. Constrained Newton  |
//|     steps greatly increase convergence speed and precision.      |
//|   * algorithm interleaves CG and Newton iterations which  allows |
//|     to handle indefinite matrices (CG phase) and quickly converge|
//|     after final set of constraints is found (Newton phase).      |
//|     Combination of CG and Newton phases is called "outer         |
//|     iteration".                                                  |
//|   * it is possible to turn off Newton phase (beneficial for      |
//|     semidefinite problems - Cholesky decomposition will fail too |
//|     often)                                                       |
//| ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:                                           |
//|   * algorithm does not support general  linear  constraints; only|
//|     box ones are supported                                       |
//|   * Cholesky decomposition for sparse problems is performed with |
//|     Skyline Cholesky solver, which is intended for low-profile   |
//|     matrices. No profile-reducing reordering of variables is     |
//|     performed in this version of ALGLIB.                         |
//|   * problems with near-zero negative eigenvalues (or exacty zero |
//|     ones) may experience about 2-3x performance penalty. The     |
//|     reason is that Cholesky decomposition can not be performed   |
//|     until we identify directions of zero and negative curvature  |
//|     and activate corresponding boundary constraints- but we need |
//|     a lot of trial and errors because these directions  are hard |
//|     to notice in the matrix spectrum. In this case you may turn  |
//|     off Newton phase of algorithm. Large negative eigenvalues    |
//|     are  not  an  issue,  so  highly  non-convex problems can be |
//|     solved very efficiently.                                     |

//|               iteration includes some amount of CG iterations    |
//|               (from 5 to ~N) and one or several (usually small   |
//|               amount) Newton steps. Thus, one outer iteration has|
//|               high cost, but can greatly reduce funcation value. |

//|                 definite dense problems (about 2 times           |
//|                 improvement can be observed)                     |

//|                 semidefinite or slightly negative definite       |
//|                 problems - each Newton phase will bring no       |
//|                 improvement (Cholesky failure), but still will   |
//|                 require computational time.                      |

//| DESCRIPTION:                                                     |
//| This function is used to find minimum of function which is       |
//| represented as sum of squares:                                   |
//|     F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... +                       |
//|     + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])                                  |
//| using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].          |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//| This algorithm will request following information during its     |
//| operation:                                                       |
//| * function vector f[] at given point X                           |
//| * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at    |
//| given point                                                      |
//| There are several overloaded versions of MinLMOptimize()         |
//| function which correspond to different LM-like optimization      |
//| algorithms provided by this unit. You should choose version which|
//| accepts fvec() and jac() callbacks. First one is used to         |
//| calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates f[] and      |
//| Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].                                            |
//| You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ function  |
//| and then use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize() (for example,|
//| version which works with general form function and does not      |
//| provide Jacobian), but it will lead to exception being thrown    |
//| after first attempt to calculate Jacobian.                       |
//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| 1. User initializes algorithm State with MinLMCreateVJ() call    |
//| 2. User tunes m_solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),             |
//|    MinLMSetStpMax() and other functions                          |
//| 3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which takes algorithm     |
//|    State and callback functions.                                 |
//| 4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution                     |
//| 5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve another |
//|    problem with same N/M but another starting point and/or       |
//|    another function. MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already  |
//|    initialized structure.                                        |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |
//|     N       -   dimension, N>1                                   |
//|                 * if given, only leading N elements of X are     |
//|                   used                                           |
//|                 * if not given, automatically determined from    |
//|                   size of X                                      |
//|     M       -   number of functions f[i]                         |
//|     X       -   initial solution, array[0..m_n-1]                  |
//| OUTPUT PARAMETERS:                                               |
//|     State   -   structure which stores algorithm State           |
//| NOTES:                                                           |
//| 1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function |
//| 2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing       |
//|    functions, and optimization algorithm makes too large steps   |
//|    which leads to overflow, use MinLMSetStpMax() function to     |
//|    bound algorithm's steps.                                      |

//|                 large (so large that  function  behavior  is non-|

//|   * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and           |
//|     X[i]+TestStep*S[i], where X[i] is i-th component of the      |
//|     initial point and S[i] is a scale of i-th parameter          |
//|   * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points                      |
//|   * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the    |
//|     interval                                                     |
//|   * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives|
//|     at trial points and we compare its prediction with actual    |
//|     value in  the  middle point                                  |

//| OptGuard checks analytic Jacobian  against  reference  value     |

//| NOTE: other optimizers perform additional OptGuard checks for    |

//| The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments subject to |

//|   * nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x) = 0                     |
//|   * nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x) <= 0                  |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//|   *  user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), |
//|      G()                                                         |
//|   *  starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from |
//|      the feasible set                                            |
//|   *  F(), G(), H() are continuously differentiable on the        |
//|      feasible set and its neighborhood                           |
//|   *  nonlinear constraints G() and H() must have non-zero        |

//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| Constrained optimization if far more complex than the            |
//| unconstrained one. Nonlinearly constrained optimization is one   |
//| of the most esoteric numerical procedures.                       |
//| Here we give very brief outline of the MinNLC optimizer. We      |
//| strongly recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference |
//| Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide on optimization, which is   |
//| available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/                 |
//|   1. User initializes algorithm State with MinNLCCreate() call   |
//|      and chooses what NLC solver to use. There is some solver    |
//|      which is used by default, with default Settings, but you    |
//|      should NOT rely on default choice. It may change in future  |
//|      releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one can guarantee |
//|      that new solver will be able to solve your problem with     |
//|      default Settings.                                           |
//| From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be |
//| pretty sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.          |
//| In the current release following solvers can be used:            |
//|   *  SQP solver, recommended for medium-scale problems (less than|
//|      thousand of variables) with hard-to-evaluate target         |
//|      functions. Requires less function evaluations than other    |
//|      solvers but each step involves solution of QP subproblem,   |
//|      so running time may be higher than that of AUL (another     |
//|      recommended option). Activated with MinNLCSetAlgoSQP()      |
//|      function.                                                   |
//|   *  AUL solver with dense preconditioner, recommended for       |
//|      large-scale problems or for problems  with  cheap  target   |
//|      function.  Needs  more function evaluations that SQP (about |
//|      5x - 10x  times  more),  but  its iterations  are  much     |
//|      cheaper that that of SQP. Activated with MinNLCSetAlgoAUL() |
//|      function.                                                   |
//|   *  SLP solver, successive linear programming. The slowest one, |
//|      requires more target function evaluations that SQP and AUL. |
//|      However,  it  is somewhat more robust in tricky cases, so   |
//|      it can be used  as  a backup plan. Activated with           |
//|      MinNLCSetAlgoSLP() function.                                |
//|   2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker which |
//|      tries to detect possible errors in the user - supplied      |
//|      callbacks:                                                  |
//|   *  discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear         |
//|      constraints                                                 |
//|   *  errors in the analytic gradient provided by user.           |
//| This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it|
//| helps to catch common coding and problem statement errors.       |
//| OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each |
//| check performed):                                                |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardSmoothness()                                   |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardGradient()                                     |
//|   3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear           |
//|      constraints by means of calling one of the following        |
//|      functions:                                                  |
//|      a) MinNLCSetBC() for boundary constraints                   |
//|      b) MinNLCSetLC() for linear constraints                     |
//|      c) MinNLCSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints                 |
//| You may combine(a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.     |
//|   4. User sets scale of the variables with MinNLCSetScale()      |
//|      function. It  is VERY important to set  scale  of  the      |
//|      variables,  because  nonlinearly constrained problems are   |
//|      hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.              |
//|   5. User sets  stopping  conditions  with  MinNLCSetCond(). If  |
//|      NLC solver uses  inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this      |
//|      function   sets   stopping conditions for INNER iterations. |
//|   6. Finally, user calls MinNLCOptimize() function  which  takes |
//|      algorithm State and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback    |
//|      function which calculates F / G / H.                        |
//|   7. User calls MinNLCResults() to get solution; additionally you|
//|      can retrieve OptGuard report with MinNLCOptGuardResults(),  |
//|      and get detailed report about purported errors in the target|
//|      function with:                                              |
//|      *  MinNLCOptGuardNonC1Test0Results()                        |
//|      *  MinNLCOptGuardNonC1Test1Results()                        |
//|   8. Optionally user may call MinNLCRestartFrom() to solve       |
//|      another  problem with same N but another starting point.    |
//|      MinNLCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized     |
//|      structure.                                                  |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |

//|               * if given, only leading N elements of X are used  |
//|               * if not given, automatically determined from size |
//|                 of X                                             |

//|               * it is better to set X to a feasible point        |
//|               * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm |

//|   1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation. |
//|   2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to            |
//|      DiffStep*S[I] where S[] is scaling vector which can be set  |
//|      by MinNLCSetScale() call.                                   |
//|   3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation |
//|      step. Too large step will result in too large TRUNCATION    |
//|      errors, while too small step will result in too large       |
//|      NUMERICAL errors. 1.0E-4 can be good value to start from.   |
//|   4. Numerical differentiation is very inefficient - one gradient|
//|      calculation needs 4 * N function evaluations. This function |
//|      will work for any N - either small(1...10), moderate        |
//|      (10...100) or large(100...). However, performance penalty   |
//|      will be too severe for any N's except for small ones. We    |
//|      should also say that code which relies on numerical         |
//|      differentiation is less robust and precise. Imprecise       |
//|      gradient may slow down convergence, especially on highly    |
//|      nonlinear problems. Thus we recommend to use this function  |
//|      for fast prototyping on small-dimensional problems only,    |
//|      and to implement analytical gradient as soon as possible.   |

//|      (candidate point can be too far away from true solution;    |
//|      large violation of constraints is possible) and is          |
//|      comparable with that of penalty methods.                    |

//|               * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   |
//|                 desired precision. Minimum value is              |
//|                 10 * max(S'*diag(H)*S), where S is a scale matrix|
//|                 (set by MinNLCSetScale) and H is a Hessian of the|
//|                 function being minimized. If you can not easily  |
//|                 estimate Hessian norm, see our recommendations   |
//|                 below.                                           |
//|               * not TOO large to prevent ill - conditioning      |
//|               * for unit - scale problems(variables and Hessian  |
//|                 have unit magnitude), Rho = 100 or Rho = 1000 can|

//|                 in current version).                             |
//|               * ItsCnt = 1 means that AUL algorithm performs just|

//| HOW TO CHOOSE PARAMETERS                                         |
//| Nonlinear optimization is a tricky area and Augmented Lagrangian |
//| algorithm is sometimes hard to tune. Good values of Rho and      |
//| ItsCnt are problem - specific. In order to help you we prepared  |
//| following set of recommendations:                                |
//|   * for  unit-scale problems (variables and Hessian have unit    |
//|     magnitude), Rho = 100 or Rho = 1000 can be used.             |
//|   * start from some small value of Rho and solve problem with    |
//|     just one outer iteration (ItcCnt = 1). In this case algorithm|
//|     behaves like penalty method. Increase Rho in 2x or 10x steps |
//|     until you see that one outer iteration returns point which is|
//|     "rough approximation to solution".                           |
//| It is very important to have Rho so large that penalty term      |
//| becomes constraining i.e. modified function becomes highly convex|
//| in constrained directions.                                       |
//| From the other side, too large Rho may prevent you from          |
//| converging to the solution. You can diagnose it by studying      |
//| number of inner iterations performed by algorithm: too few (5-10 |
//| on 1000-dimensional problem) or too many (orders of magnitude    |
//| more than dimensionality) usually means that Rho is too large.   |
//|   * with just one outer iteration you usually have low-quality   |
//|     solution. Some constraints can be violated with very large   |
//|     margin, while other ones (which are NOT violated in the true |
//|     solution) can push final  point too far in the inner area of |
//|     the feasible set.                                            |
//| For example, if you have constraint x0 >= 0 and true solution    |
//| x0=1, then merely a presence of "x0>=0" will introduce a bias  |
//| towards larger values of x0. Say, algorithm may stop at x0 = 1.5 |
//| instead of 1.0.                                                  |
//|   * after you found good Rho, you may increase number of outer   |
//|     iterations. ItsCnt = 10 is a good value. Subsequent outer    |
//|     iteration will refine values of  Lagrange  multipliers.      |
//|     Constraints which were violated will be enforced, inactive   |
//|     constraints will be dropped(corresponding multipliers will be|
//|     decreased). Ideally, you should see 10-1000x improvement in  |
//|     constraint handling(constraint violation is reduced).        |
//|   * if you see that algorithm converges to vicinity of solution, |
//|     but additional outer iterations do not refine solution, it   |
//|     may mean that algorithm is unstable - it wanders around true |
//|     solution, but can not approach it. Sometimes algorithm may be|
//|     stabilized by increasing Rho one more time, making it 5x or  |
//|     10x larger.                                                  |
//| SCALING OF CONSTRAINTS [IMPORTANT]                               |
//| AUL optimizer scales variables according to scale specified  by  |
//| MinNLCSetScale() function, so it can handle problems with badly  |
//| scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales). However,     |
//| because function being optimized is a mix of original function   |
//| and constraint - dependent penalty functions, it is important to |
//| rescale both variables AND constraints.                          |
//| Say, if you minimize f(x) = x^2 subject to 1000000*x >= 0,  then |
//| you have constraint whose scale is different from that of target |
//| function (another example is 0.000001*x >= 0). It is also        |
//| possible to have constraints whose scales are misaligned:        |
//| 1000000*x0 >= 0, 0.000001*x1 <= 0. Inappropriate scaling may ruin|
//| convergence because minimizing x^2 subject to x >= 0 is NOT same |
//| as minimizing it subject to 1000000*x >= 0.                      |
//| Because we know coefficients of boundary/linear constraints, we  |
//| can automatically rescale and normalize them. However, there is  |
//| no way to automatically rescale nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and  |
//| Hi(x) - they are black boxes.                                    |
//| It means that YOU are the one who is responsible for correct     |
//| scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend   |
//| you to rescale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th       |
//| component of dG/dX (or dH/dx) has magnitude approximately equal  |
//| to 1/S[i] (where S is a scale set by MinNLCSetScale() function). |
//| WHAT IF IT DOES NOT CONVERGE?                                    |
//| It is possible that AUL algorithm fails to converge to precise   |
//| values of Lagrange multipliers. It stops somewhere around true   |
//| solution, but candidate point is still too far from solution,    |
//| and some constraints are violated. Such kind of failure is       |
//| specific for Lagrangian algorithms - technically, they stop at   |
//| some point, but this point is not constrained solution.          |
//| There are exist several reasons why algorithm may fail to        |
//| converge:                                                        |
//|   a) too loose stopping criteria for inner iteration             |
//|   b) degenerate, redundant constraints                           |
//|   c) target function has unconstrained extremum exactly at the   |
//|      boundary of some constraint                                 |
//|   d) numerical noise in the target function                      |
//| In all these cases algorithm is unstable - each outer iteration  |
//| results in large and almost random step which improves handling  |
//| of some constraints, but violates other ones (ideally outer      |
//| iterations should form a sequence of progressively decreasing    |
//| steps towards solution).                                         |
//| First reason possible is that too loose stopping criteria for    |
//| inner iteration were specified. Augmented Lagrangian algorithm   |
//| solves a sequence of intermediate problems, and requries each of |
//| them to be solved with high precision. Insufficient precision    |
//| results in incorrect update of  Lagrange multipliers.            |
//| Another reason is that you may have specified degenerate         |
//| constraints: say, some constraint was repeated twice. In most    |
//| cases AUL algorithm gracefully handles such situations, but      |
//| sometimes it may spend too much time figuring out subtle         |
//| degeneracies in constraint matrix.                               |
//| Third reason is tricky and hard to diagnose. Consider situation  |
//| when you minimize  f = x^2  subject to constraint x >= 0.        |
//| Unconstrained extremum is located exactly at the boundary of     |
//| constrained area. In this case algorithm will tend to oscillate  |
//| between negative and positive x. Each time it stops at x<0 it    |
//| "reinforces" constraint x >= 0, and each time it  is bounced to  |
//| x>0 it "relaxes" constraint( and is  attracted  to  x < 0).    |
//| Such situation sometimes happens in problems with hidden         |
//| symetries. Algorithm is got caught in a loop with Lagrange       |
//| multipliers  being continuously increased / decreased. Luckily,  |
//| such loop forms after at  least three iterations, so this problem|
//| can be solved by  DECREASING  number  of outer iterations down   |
//| to 1-2 and increasing penalty coefficient Rho as much as possible|
//| Final reason is numerical noise. AUL algorithm is robust against |
//| moderate noise (more robust than, say, active set methods),  but |
//| large  noise  may destabilize algorithm.                         |

//| ===== TRACING SLP SOLVER ======================================= |
//| SLP solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace |
//| algorithm output by specifying following trace symbols  (case-   |
//| insensitive) by means of trace_file() call:                      |
//|   * 'SLP'  -  for basic trace of algorithm steps and decisions.  |
//|               Only short scalars(function values and deltas) are |
//|               printed.                                           |
//|               N-dimensional quantities like search directions are|
//|               NOT printed.                                       |
//|               It also prints OptGuard integrity checker report   |
//|               when nonsmoothness of target / constraints is      |
//|               suspected.                                         |
//|   * 'SLP.DETAILED' - for output of points being visited and      |
//|               search directions.                                 |
//|               This symbol also implicitly defines 'SLP'. You can |
//|               control output format by additionally specifying:  |
//|               * nothing to output in 6-digit exponential format  |
//|               * 'PREC.E15' to output in 15-digit exponential     |
//|                  format                                          |
//|               * 'PREC.F6' to output in 6-digit fixed-point format|
//|   * 'SLP.PROBING' - to let algorithm insert additional function  |
//|               evaluations before line search in order to build   |
//|               human-readable chart of the raw Lagrangian         |
//|               (~40 additional function evaluations is performed  |
//|               for each line search). This symbol also implicitly |
//|               defines 'SLP'. Definition of this symbol also      |
//|               automatically activates OptGuard smoothness monitor|
//|   * 'OPTGUARD'  - for report of smoothness/continuity violations |
//|               in target and/or constraints. This kind of         |
//|               reporting is included in 'SLP', but it comes with  |
//|               lots of additional Info. If you need just          |
//|               smoothness monitoring, specify this setting.       |
//| NOTE: this tag merely directs OptGuard output to log file. Even  |
//|       if you specify it, you still have to configure OptGuard by |
//|       calling MinNLCOptGuard...() family of functions.           |
//| By default trace is disabled and adds no overhead to the         |
//| optimization process. However, specifying any of the symbols adds|
//| some formatting and output - related overhead. Specifying        |
//| 'SLP.PROBING' adds  even larger overhead due to additional       |
//| function evaluations being performed.                            |
//| You may specify multiple symbols by separating them with commas: |

//| This  function tells MinNLC optimizer to use SQP (Successive     |
//| Quadratic Programming) algorithm for nonlinearly constrained     |
//| optimization.                                                    |
//| This algorithm needs order of magnitude (5x-10x) less function   |
//| evaluations than AUL solver, but has higher overhead because each|
//| iteration involves solution of quadratic programming problem.    |
//| Convergence is proved for the following case:                    |
//|   *  function and constraints are continuously differentiable    |
//|      (C1 class)                                                  |
//| This algorithm has following nice properties:                    |
//|   *  no parameters to tune                                       |
//|   *  no convexity requirements for target function or constraints|
//|   *  initial point can be infeasible                             |
//|   *  algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate      |
//|      points (it does not even evaluate function outside of box   |
//|      constrained area)                                           |
//|   *  once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not    |
//|      violate them                                                |
//|   *  no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear            |
//|      constraints, but once nonlinear constraints are enforced,   |
//|      algorithm will try to respect them as much as possible      |
//|   *  numerical differentiation does not violate box constraints  |
//|      (although general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated |
//|      during differentiation)                                     |
//| We recommend this algorithm as a default option for medium scale |
//| problems (less than thousand of variables) or problems with      |
//| target function being hard to evaluate.                          |
//| For  large-scale problems or ones with very cheap target function|
//| AUL solver can be better option.                                 |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |
//|   State    -  structure which stores algorithm State             |
//| ===== INTERACTION WITH OPTGUARD ================================ |
//| OptGuard integrity checker allows us to catch problems like      |
//| errors in gradients  and discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the      |
//| target/constraints. The latter kind of problems can be detected  |
//| by looking upon line searches performed during optimization and  |
//| searching for signs of nonsmoothness.                            |
//| The problem with SQP is that it is too good for OptGuard to work-|
//| it does not perform line searches. It typically needs 1-2        |
//| function evaluations per step, and it is not enough for OptGuard |
//| to detect nonsmoothness.                                         |
//| So, if you suspect that your problem is nonsmooth and if you want|
//| to confirm or deny it, we recommend you to either:               |
//|   *  use AUL or SLP solvers, which can detect nonsmoothness of   |
//|      the problem                                                 |
//|   *  or, alternatively, activate 'SQP.PROBING' trace tag that    |
//|      will insert additional function evaluations (~40 per line   |
//|      step) that will help OptGuard integrity checker to study    |
//|      properties of your problem                                  |
//| ===== TRACING SQP SOLVER ======================================= |
//| SQP solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace |
//| algorithm output by specifying following trace symbols (case-    |
//| insensitive) by means of trace_file() call:                      |
//|   * 'SQP'     -  for basic trace of algorithm steps and          |
//|                  decisions. Only short scalars (function values  |
//|                  and deltas) are printed.                        |

//|   * 'SQP.DETAILED' - for output of points being visited and      |
//|                  search directions. This symbol also implicitly  |
//|                  defines 'SQP'. You can control output format by |

//| This function activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring     |
//| option of the OptGuard integrity checker. Smoothness monitor     |
//| silently observes solution process and tries to detect ill-posed |
//| problems, i.e. ones with:                                        |
//|   a) discontinuous target function(non-C0) and/or constraints    |
//|   b) nonsmooth   target function(non-C1) and/or constraints      |
//| Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization even if it |
//| suspects that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets            |
//| corresponding flags in the OptGuard report which can be retrieved|
//| after optimization is over.                                      |
//| Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often  |
//| adds less than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can   |
//| use it even for large scale problems.                            |
//| NOTE:   OptGuard does NOT guarantee that it will always detect   |
//|         C0/C1 continuity violations.                             |
//| First, minor errors are hard to catch-say, a 0.0001 difference   |
//| in the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to        |
//| discontinuity of the model - or simply because the model has     |
//| changed.                                                         |
//| Second, C1-violations are especially difficult to detect in a    |
//| noninvasive way. The optimizer usually performs very short steps |
//| near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation usually  introduces  |
//| a lot of numerical noise. It is hard to tell whether some tiny   |
//| discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  |
//| due to numerical noise alone.                                    |
//| Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare   |
//| cases minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases    |
//| they can be spotted with restart from different initial point).  |

//|                     function values and/or gradients are         |
//|                     recorded, but OptGuard does not try to       |
//|                     perform additional evaluations in order      |
//|                     to get more information about suspicious     |
//|                     locations.                                   |
//| This kind of monitoring does not work well with SQP because SQP  |
//| solver needs just 1-2 function evaluations per step, which is not|
//| enough for OptGuard to make any conclusions.                     |
//| === EXPLANATION ================================================ |
//| One major source of headache during optimization is the          |
//| possibility of the coding errors in the target function/         |
//| constraints (or their gradients). Such errors  most  often       |
//| manifest  themselves as discontinuity or nonsmoothness of the    |
//| target/constraints.                                              |
//| Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something |
//| involving lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth     |
//| target. Although not a coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway -|
//| and smooth optimizers usually stop right after encountering      |
//| nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.                    |
//| OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations:   |
//| it monitors function values/gradients being passed to the        |
//| optimizer and tries to errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair  |

//| === PRIMARY REPORT ============================================= |
//| OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch     |
//| common errors in the implementation of nonlinear function/       |
//| gradient:                                                        |
//|   * incorrect analytic gradient                                  |
//|   * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)        |
//|   * nonsmooth (non-C1) target functions (constraints)            |
//| Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:     |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardGradient() for gradient verification           |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardSmoothness() for C0/C1 checks                  |
//| Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:         |
//|   * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:                      |
//|         * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row)   |
//|                           suspected                              |
//|         * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column)|
//|                           suspected                              |

//|         * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained   |
//|                           via numerical differentiation          |

//|         * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating|

//|         * rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally                   |
//|         * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating|
//|                           C1 continuity                          |
//| Here function index 0 means target function, index 1 or higher   |
//| denotes nonlinear constraints.                                   |
//| === ADDITIONAL REPORTS / LOGS ================================== |
//| Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you |
//| can find out specific test signaled error by looking to:         |
//|   * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0                   |
//|   * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0                   |
//|   * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1                   |
//| Additional information (including line search logs) can be       |
//| obtained  by means of:                                           |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardNonC1Test0Results()                            |
//|   * MinNLCOptGuardNonC1Test1Results()                            |
//| which return detailed error reports, specific points where       |
//| discontinuities were found, and so on.                           |

//|               be retrieved with other functions.                 |
//| NOTE:   false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified   |
//|         as nonsmooth ones) are possible although unlikely.       |
//| The reason is that you need to make several evaluations around   |
//| nonsmoothness in order to accumulate enough information about    |
//| function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth   |
//| point, optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what |
//| is going wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the |
//| derivative. It is also possible that "unlucky" step will move us |
//| to the termination too quickly.                                  |
//| Our current approach is to have less than 0.1 % false negatives  |
//| in our test examples (measured with multiple restarts from random|
//| points), and to have exactly 0 % false positives.                |

//| SUBJECT TO BOX / LINEAR / NONLINEAR - NONSMOOTH CONSTRAINTS      |
//| DESCRIPTION:                                                     |
//| The subroutine minimizes function  F(x) of N arguments subject to|
//| any combination of:                                              |
//|   * bound constraints                                            |
//|   * linear inequality constraints                                |
//|   * linear equality constraints                                  |
//|   * nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x) = 0                     |
//|   * nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x) <= 0                  |
//| IMPORTANT: see MinNSSetAlgoAGS for important information on      |
//|            performance restrictions of AGS solver.               |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//|   * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from  |
//|     the feasible set                                             |
//|   * F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz and          |
//|     continuously (but not necessarily twice) differentiable in an|
//|     open dense subset of R^N.                                    |
//| Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.      |
//| Informally speaking, it means that functions are composed of     |
//| large differentiable "patches" with nonsmoothness having place   |
//| only at the boundaries between these "patches". Most real-life   |
//| nonsmooth functions satisfy these requirements. Say, anything    |
//| which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is very   |
//| likely to pass the test. Say, it is possible to optimize anything|
//| of the following:                                                |
//|   * f = abs(x0) + 2 * abs(x1)                                    |
//|   * f = max(x0, x1)                                              |
//|   * f = sin(max(x0, x1) + abs(x2))                               |
//|   * for nonlinearly constrained problems: F() must be bounded    |
//|     from below without nonlinear constraints (this requirement   |
//|     is due to the fact that, contrary to box and linear          |
//|     constraints, nonlinear ones require special handling).       |
//|   * user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(),  |
//|     G() at all points where function / gradient can be calculated|
//|     If optimizer requires value exactly at the boundary between  |
//|     "patches"(say, at x = 0 for f = abs(x)), where gradient is   |
//|     not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in our case - |
//|     return +1 or -1 at its discretion).                          |
//|   * NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may    |
//|     differentiate your function for you, but it results in 2N    |
//|     increase of function evaluations. Not recommended unless you |
//|     solve really small problems. See MinNSCreateF() for more     |
//|     information on this functionality.                           |
//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| 1. User initializes algorithm State with MinNSCreate() call and  |
//|    chooses what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is |
//|    used by default, with default Settings, but you should NOT    |
//|    rely on default choice. It may change in future releases of   |
//|    ALGLIB without notice, and no one can guarantee that new      |
//|    solver will be able to solve your problem with default        |
//|    Settings.                                                     |
//| From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be |
//| pretty sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.          |
//| In the current release following solvers can be used:            |
//|   * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)       |
//| 2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints |
//|    by means of calling one of the following functions:           |
//|      a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints                    |
//|      b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints                      |
//|      c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints                  |
//|   You may combine(a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.   |
//| 3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function|
//|    It is VERY important to set scale of the variables, because   |
//|    nonlinearly constrained problems are hard to solve when       |
//|    variables are badly scaled.                                   |
//| 4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().            |
//| 5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize() function which takes      |
//|    algorithm State and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback       |
//|    function which calculates F / G / H.                          |
//| 6. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution                     |
//| 7. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve another  |
//|    problem with same N but another starting point.               |
//|    MinNSRestartFrom() allows  to reuse already initialized       |
//|    structure.                                                    |

//|               * if not given, automatically determined from size |
//|                 of X                                             |

//|               * it is better to set X to a feasible point        |
//|               * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm |
//|                 will try to find feasible point first, using X as|
//|                 initial approximation.                           |

//|         uses numerical differentiation with user-specified step. |

//| NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only approximately!  |
//|         It is possible that algorithm will evaluate function     |
//|         outside of the feasible area!                            |
//| NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables according to scale specified  |
//|         by MinNSSetScale() function, so it can handle problems   |
//|         with badly scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their    |
//|         scales).                                                 |
//| However, there is no way to automatically scale nonlinear        |
//| constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling of Gi/Hi may  |
//| ruin convergence. Solving problem with constraint "1000*G0(x)=0" |
//| is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".       |
//| It means that YOU are the one who is responsible for correct     |
//| scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend   |
//| you to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th         |
//| component of dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit magnitude   |
//| (for problems with unit scale) or has magnitude approximately    |
//| equal to 1/S[i] (where S is a scale set by MinNSSetScale()       |
//| function).                                                       |
//| NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle, no      |
//|         matter what algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/    |
//|         linear constraints modify function curvature by adding   |
//|         valleys and ridges. However, nonlinear constraints add   |
//|         valleys which are very hard to follow due to their       |
//|         "curved" nature.                                         |

//| This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS (adaptive gradient    |

//| Adaptive Gradient Sampling Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization" |
//| by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.                            |
//| This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:             |
//|   + robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex      |
//|                 functions.                                       |
//|   + relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy  |
//|                 to select.                                       |
//|   - it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.|
//|   - each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values and|
//|     solution of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which limits|
//|     applicability of algorithm by small-scale problems (up       |
//|     to 50 - 100).                                                |
//| IMPORTANT: this algorithm has convergence guarantees, i.e. it    |
//|            will steadily move towards some stationary point of   |
//|            the function.                                         |
//| However, "stationary point" does not  always  mean  "solution".  |
//| Nonsmooth problems often have "flat spots", i.e. areas where     |
//| function do not change at all. Such "flat spots" are stationary  |
//| points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.          |
//| Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to this problem. Say, if    |
//| your function has form f() = MAX(f0, f1, ...), and f_i are convex|
//| then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to  |
//| solution.                                                        |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |

//|                  specified by MinNSSetScale().                   |
//|                  You should select relatively large sampling     |
//|                  radius, roughly proportional to scaled length   |
//|                  of the first steps of the algorithm. Something  |
//|                  close to 0.1 in magnitude should be good for    |
//|                  most problems.                                  |
//|                  AGS solver can automatically decrease radius,   |
//|                  so too large radius is not a problem (assuming  |
//|                  that you won't choose so large radius that      |
//|                  algorithm will sample function in too far away  |
//|                  points, where gradient value is irrelevant).    |
//|                  Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, |

//|                    of the function. Starting from some problem - |
//|                    specific value penalty coefficient becomes    |
//|                    large enough to exactly enforce nonlinear     |
//|                    constraints; larger values do not improve     |
//|                    precision. Increasing it too much may slow    |
//|                    down convergence, so you should choose it     |
//|                    carefully.                                    |

//| ALGORITHM OUTLINE                                                |
//| The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given   |
//| below:                                                           |
//| 0. If sampling radius is below EpsX or we performed more then    |
//|    MaxIts iterations - STOP.                                     |
//| 1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations around current|
//|    point; informally speaking, this sample is an implicit        |
//|    piecewise linear model of the function, although algorithm    |
//|    formulation does not mention that explicitly                  |
//| 2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent  |
//|    direction                                                     |
//| 3. if QP solver tells us that we are near solution, decrease     |
//|    sampling radius and move to(0)                                |
//| 4. perform backtracking line search                              |
//| 5. after moving to new point, goto(0)                            |
//| Constraint handling details:                                     |
//|   * box constraints are handled exactly by algorithm             |
//|   * linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1        |
//|     penalty. Because our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can |
//|     use L1 penalty function, which is an exact one (i.e. exact   |
//|     solution is returned under such penalty).                    |
//|   * penalty coefficient for linear constraints is chosen         |
//|     automatically; however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear    |
//|     constraints must be specified by user.                       |
//| ===== TRACING AGS SOLVER ======================================= |

//|   * 'AGS'        -  for basic trace of algorithm steps and       |

//|                     values and deltas) are printed. N-dimensional|
//|                     quantities like search directions are NOT    |
//|                     printed.                                     |
//|   * 'AGS.DETAILED' - for output of points being visited and      |
//|                     search directions. This symbol also          |
//|                     implicitly defines 'AGS'. You can control    |
//|                     output format by additionally specifying:    |
//|                     * nothing to output in 6-digit exponential   |
//|                       format                                     |

//| BOX CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION WITH FAST ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE BOX|
//| CONSTRAINTS                                                      |
//| DESCRIPTION:                                                     |
//| The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments subject to |
//| box constraints (with some of box constraints actually being     |
//| equality ones).                                                  |
//| This optimizer uses algorithm similar to that of MinBLEIC        |
//| (optimizer with general linear constraints), but presence of     |
//| box-only constraints allows us to use faster constraint          |
//| activation strategies. On large-scale problems, with multiple    |
//| constraints active at the solution, this optimizer can be several|
//| times faster than BLEIC.                                         |
//| REQUIREMENTS:                                                    |
//|   * user must provide function value and gradient                |
//|   * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from  |
//|     the feasible set                                             |
//|   * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:         |
//|               L = { x : f(x) <= f(x0) }                          |
//|   * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F    |
//| USAGE:                                                           |
//| Constrained optimization if far more complex than the            |
//| unconstrained one. Here we give very brief outline of the BC     |
//| optimizer. We strongly recommend you to read examples in the     |
//| ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide on         |
//| optimization, which is available at                              |
//|         http://www.alglib.net/optimization/                      |
//| 1. User initializes algorithm State with MinBCCreate() call      |
//| 2. USer adds box constraints by calling MinBCSetBC() function.   |
//| 3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBCSetCond().            |
//| 4. User calls MinBCOptimize() function which takes algorithm     |
//|    State and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which |
//|    calculates F / G.                                             |
//| 5. User calls MinBCResults() to get solution                     |
//| 6. Optionally user may call MinBCRestartFrom() to solve another  |
//|    problem with same N but another starting point.               |
//|    MinBCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized        |

//|               * it is better to set X to a feasible point        |
//|               * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm |
//|                 will try to find feasible point first, using X as|

//|   1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation. |
//|   2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to            |
//|      DiffStep*S[I] where S[] is scaling vector which can be set  |
//|      by MinBCSetScale() call.                                    |
//| 3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation   |
//|    step. Too large step will result in too large truncation      |
//|    errors, while too small step will result in too large         |
//|    numerical errors. 1.0E-6 can be good value to start with.     |
//| 4. Numerical differentiation is very inefficient - one gradient  |
//|    calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will|
//|    work for any N - either small(1...10), moderate(10...100) or  |
//|    large(100...). However, performance penalty will be too severe|
//|    for any N's except for small ones.                            |
//|    We should also say that code which relies on numerical        |
//|    differentiation is less robust and precise. CG needs exact    |
//|    gradient values. Imprecise gradient may slow down convergence,|
//|    especially on highly nonlinear problems.                      |
//|    Thus we recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on|
//|    small-dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical  |
//|    gradient as soon as possible.                                 |

//| This function sets scaling coefficients for BC optimizer.        |
//| ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping          |
//| conditions (step size and gradient are scaled before comparison  |
//| with tolerances). Scale of the I-th variable is a translation    |
//| invariant measure of:                                            |
//|   a) "how large" the variable is                                 |
//|   b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in |
//|      the function                                                |
//| Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the         |
//| optimizer - step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].      |
//| In most optimizers (and in the BC too) scaling is NOT a form of  |
//| preconditioning. It just affects stopping conditions. You should |
//| set preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinBCSetPrec...|
//| functions.                                                       |
//| There is a special preconditioning mode, however, which uses     |
//| scaling coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You|
//| can turn this mode on, if you want. But you should understand    |
//| that scaling is not the same thing as preconditioning - these are|
//| two different, although related forms of tuning solver.          |

//| This function activates / deactivates verification of the user - |

//| Upon activation of this option OptGuard integrity checker        |
//| performs numerical differentiation of your target function at    |
//| the initial point (note: future versions may also perform check  |
//| at the final point) and compares numerical gradient with analytic|
//| one provided by you.                                             |
//| If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization|
//| session continues. After optimization session is over, you can   |
//| retrieve the report which stores both gradients and specific     |
//| components highlighted as suspicious by the OptGuard.            |
//| The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with                |
//| MinBCOptGuardResults().                                          |
//| IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high - overhead option which will |
//| cost you about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases|
//| it may cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.     |
//| YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO  |
//| CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.                  |
//| NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code, |
//|       OptGuard does NOT interrupt optimization even if it        |
//|       discovers bad gradient.                                    |

//|                  which is too large (so large that function      |
//|                  behavior is non-cubic at this scale) will lead  |
//|                  to false alarms. Too short step will result in  |
//|                  rounding errors dominating numerical derivative.|

//| === EXPLANATION ================================================ |
//| In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:  |
//|   * two trial steps are made to X[i] - TestStep * S[i] and       |
//|     X[i] + TestStep * S[i], where X[i] is i-th component of the  |
//|     initial point and S[i] is a scale of i-th parameter          |
//|   * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points                      |
//|   * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the    |
//|     interval                                                     |
//|   * we build cubic model using function values and derivatives   |
//|     at trial points and we compare its prediction with actual    |
//|     value in the middle point                                    |

//| This  function  activates / deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring |
//| option of the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor |
//| silently observes solution process and tries to detect ill-posed |
//| problems, i.e. ones with:                                        |
//|   a) discontinuous target function(non - C0)                     |
//|   b) nonsmooth     target function(non - C1)                     |
//| Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it|
//| suspects that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets            |
//| corresponding flags in the OptGuard report which can be retrieved|
//| after optimization is over.                                      |
//| Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often  |
//| adds less than 1 % to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can  |

//|       C0 / C1 continuity violations.                             |
//| First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference|

//| Second, C1 - violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  |

//| whether  some  tiny discontinuity in the slope is due to real    |
//| nonsmoothness or just  due to numerical noise alone.             |
//| Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare   |

//| can be spotted with restart from different initial point).       |

//|                  function values and / or gradients are recorded,|
//|                  but OptGuard does not try to perform additional |
//|                  evaluations  in  order  to get more information |
//|                  about suspicious locations.                     |
//| === EXPLANATION ================================================ |
//| One  major  source  of  headache  during  optimization  is  the  |
//| possibility of the coding errors in the target function /        |
//| constraints (or their gradients). Such  errors   most   often    |
//| manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or nonsmoothness of the|
//| target / constraints.                                            |
//| Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something |
//| involving lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth     |
//| target. Although not  a coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway-|
//| and smooth  optimizers  usually stop right after encountering    |
//| nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.                    |
//| OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations:   |
//| it monitors function values / gradients being passed  to  the    |
//| optimizer and tries  to errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair |
//| of points it  raises appropriate flag (and allows you to continue|
//| optimization). When optimization is done, you can study OptGuard |
//| result.                                                          |

//| === PRIMARY REPORT ============================================= |
//| OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch     |
//| common errors in the implementation of nonlinear function /      |
//| gradient:                                                        |
//|   * incorrect analytic gradient                                  |
//|   * discontinuous(non - C0) target functions(constraints)        |
//|   * nonsmooth(non - C1) target functions(constraints)            |
//| Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:     |
//|   * MinBCOptGuardGradient() for gradient verification            |
//|   * MinBCOptGuardSmoothness() for C0 / C1 checks                 |
//| Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:         |
//|   * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:                      |
//|      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element)  |
//|        suspected                                                 |
//|      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested        |
//|      * rep.badgraduser, user - provided gradient(stored  as  2D  |
//|        matrix with single row in order to make report structure  |
//|        compatible  with  more complex optimizers like MinNLC or  |
//|        MinLM)                                                    |
//|      * rep.badgradnum,  reference   gradient   obtained   via    |
//|        numerical differentiation (stored as 2D matrix with single|
//|        row in order to make report structure compatible with more|
//|        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)                  |
//|   * rep.nonc0suspected                                           |
//|   * rep.nonc1suspected                                           |
//| === ADDITIONAL REPORTS / LOGS ================================== |
//| Several different tests are performed to catch C0 / C1 errors,   |
//| you can find out specific test signaled error by looking to:     |
//|   * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non - C0 test #0                 |
//|   * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non - C1 test #0                 |
//|   * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non - C1 test #1                 |
//| Additional information (including line search logs) can  be      |
//| obtained by means of:                                            |
//|   * MinBCOptGuardNonC1Test0Results()                             |
//|   * MinBCOptGuardNonC1Test1Results()                             |
//| which return detailed error reports, specific points where       |
//| discontinuities were found, and so on.                           |
//| ================================================================ |
//| INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                |
//|   State    -  algorithm State                                    |

//|   Rep      -  generic OptGuard report; more  detailed  reports   |
//|               can  be retrieved with other functions.            |
//| NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  |
//|       nonsmooth ones) are possible although unlikely.            |
//| The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations    |
//| around nonsmoothness in order to accumulate  enough  information |
//| about function curvature. Say, if you start right from the       |
//| nonsmooth point, optimizer simply won't get enough data to       |
//| understand what is going wrong before it terminates due to abrupt|
//| changes in the  derivative. It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"|
//| step  will  move  us  to  the termination too quickly.           |
//| Our current approach is to have less than 0.1 %  false  negatives|
//| in our test examples(measured  with  multiple  restarts  from    |
//| random points), and to have exactly 0 % false positives.         |
